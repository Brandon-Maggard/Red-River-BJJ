                    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
                    <p>Red River Brazililan Jiu-jitsu is a family-owned business. Professor Ben and Professor Vanessa are the proud owners of this school, and both are US Air Force veterans. Professor Ben has been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu since 2005 while stationed in Anchorage, Alaska. He started training under Professor Ted Stickel at Gracie Barra, Anchorage, Alaska. The family moved to Sheppard Air Force Base, Wichita Falls, TX in 2009 and realized there was no Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu schools in the area. They both decided to open the school and share this wonderful art with the community. In 2014, yet another military move sent them both to the Pentagon, Washington DC. Both decided to retire after 20 years of service each and return to Wichita Falls to run the school full time. Ben and Vanessa are both black belts under Bruno Bastos. Their son Leo is a brown belt who coaches when he's in town visiting from college, and their youngest son Edy, is well on his way to become a great coach himself. They are proud to offer martial arts in a family friendly environment for all families to train. They truly love to share their knowledge with the community.</p>
