                    <h2>Newcomers</h2>
                    <p>Trying something new can be very intimidating and maybe a little scary. I'd like to put you at ease and assure you that this is a family oriented environment and very friendly. Jiu-jitsu is a gentle sport that was created for the smaller, weaker opponent. So, no, you will not get beat-up in our gym, no, you will not get punched in the face and no, you will not get kicked. Jiu-jitsu teaches a person to grapple using their own weight and technique to submit an opponent. I guarantee that you will be so hooked with RR BJJ that you will be upset at yourself for not coming in earlier. The benefits of Jiu-jitsu are endless. People join for many reasons, some want to lose weight, others want to learn self-defense, others want to one day fight in MMA. Whatever your reason is, you will have a lot of fun! Now, first give us a call at <a href="tel:+9402571302">(940)257-1302</a> to set up a date and time.</p>
