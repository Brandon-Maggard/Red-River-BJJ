# Red-River-BJJ
Website redesign for a BJJ gym.

Red River BJJ is a mom-and-pop jiu jitsu gym that is owned by two Air Force veterans. They have a website that they created themselves when they started their business, and it was not professional looking and was not responsive. Knowing that a professional looking website is key to getting new customers, they were in need of a redesign. The approach we took was, using their existing site and social media assets, to create an updated website that had a responsive design and to make it look more professional for new and existing customers.
