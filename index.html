                    <h2>What is Jiu-Jitsu?</h2>
                    <p>Brazilian Jiu-jitsu is a martial art which uses technique to subdue an opponent with greater size and strength by using less strength and more technique. This is done by using one's body and maximizing leverage, position as well as your opponent's to gain control. One can use technique to subdue their opponent without hurting them by establishing a position of control like side control, mount, knee on belly, or by taking their back. From these positions one can continue to submit their opponent by hyper extending their opponent's arms, legs or other extremities or by choking, just to name a few. In a training environment, the student taps with their hand to let their partner know to stop and continue training without getting hurt. Students find it challenging yet rewarding after training a few weeks in the art. Students also learn the limits of their own bodies which in turn helps them achieve greater goals, surpass previous plateaus and always results in increased confidence.  Wether you want to add to your fitness routine, learn self-defence, or want to complete Red River Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is the place for you.</p>
